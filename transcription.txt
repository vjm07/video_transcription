[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:10.000]  I've been with my cold hands, the shapes I used to take, the shapes I used to take, the shapes I used to take.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:38.850]  And I'm still here. I'm still here. Oh, the reason's gone like knives can probably end in my mind. All the times I've had to fight, I'm still here.
